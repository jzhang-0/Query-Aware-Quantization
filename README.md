## Intro.
This is the code of Query-Aware Quantization for Maximum Inner Product Search. I'm the first author.

The proposed method is implemented by Julia and all basleines are implmented by Python.

To use this code, you need to check requirements.txt carefully.

We provide the data of lastfm and run script for reproducing results. If you need all datasets used in paper, welcome to contact with me.
